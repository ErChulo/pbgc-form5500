# Implementation Plan: Ingestion Local, Remote, and EFAST CSV

**Branch**: `001-ingestion-local-and-remote-and-efast-csv` | **Date**: 2026-03-31 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ingestion-local-and-remote-and-efast-csv/spec.md`

## Summary

Build a browser-only ingestion workspace with four input modes, one shared queue,
one throttled render path, and one remote download engine reused by pasted URLs
and EFAST CSV derived items.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript running in modern browsers; Node.js 24 for build and test  
**Primary Dependencies**: No runtime dependencies; built-in browser and Node modules only  
**Storage**: In-memory browser state only; user-triggered CSV download output  
**Testing**: `node --test` unit tests for pure logic  
**Target Platform**: Modern desktop browsers opened from `file://` or served over HTTP(S)  
**Project Type**: Single-file browser application  
**Performance Goals**: Responsive queue interactions with at least 50 items; throttled DOM updates during download progress  
**Constraints**: One distributable HTML file in `/dist`; no server component; no document-content logging  
**Scale/Scope**: Initial milestone supports four ingest modes and one consolidated queue

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Single-file delivery preserved by a custom Node build that inlines CSS and JavaScript into one HTML file in `/dist`.
- No server component or external runtime assets are required for local ingestion; HTTP(S) serving is only needed when the user wants browser-permitted remote downloads.
- Privacy is preserved by keeping uploaded files, CSV contents, and downloaded bytes in memory only and by avoiding content logging.
- Accessibility is handled through keyboard-reachable controls, visible focus states, semantic tabs, and high-contrast mode.
- Performance is protected by requestAnimationFrame-based render throttling and object URL revocation on preview close.
- Typed extraction compatibility is preserved by generating or updating one extracted record per queue item, even when the queue item began as CSV metadata only.
- Post-design re-check: PASS. Research, data model, quickstart, and UI contracts remain aligned with the constitution constraints above.

**Structure Decision**: Use one small source tree with reusable pure logic in
`src/lib/core.js`, browser UI orchestration in `src/app.js`, and a custom build
script that emits the required self-contained HTML file.

## Phase 0: Research Summary

- Decision: Use a zero-dependency custom build pipeline.
  - Rationale: the project started from an empty scaffold and must emit exactly one HTML file.
- Decision: Reuse one download engine for pasted URLs and CSV-derived URLs.
  - Rationale: this keeps concurrency, cancellation, retry, and validation behavior consistent.
- Decision: Parse EFAST CSV with a resilient normalized-header mapper.
  - Rationale: EFAST exports vary in spacing, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Phase 1: Design Artifacts

- `research.md`: captures build, download-manager, and CSV-mapping decisions.
- `data-model.md`: defines `QueueItem`, `DownloadJob`, and `CsvRowMetadata`.
- `contracts/ui-contract.md`: documents queue state transitions, input contract, and user messaging expectations.
- `quickstart.md`: defines the manual validation flow for local, remote, and CSV ingestion.
- Agent context update target: `AGENTS.md` via `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`.
